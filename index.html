            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>My journey into the world of development began in 2010. As an independent freelancer, I was driven by
                the desire to create. Over seven transformative years, I crafted solutions for various clients,
                building projects like the Dena Porcelain Store and the Star VPN Store using cutting-edge
                technologies of the time. This period was instrumental in shaping my foundational skills and
                understanding of the industry.</p>

            <h3>Stepping into the Energy Sector</h3>
            <p>2017 marked a pivotal turn in my career. I joined Tabesh Rayan Energy in Tabriz, Iran. Here, I was
                introduced to the complexities of the energy sector. Using PHP, Laravel 4, and MySQL, I developed a
                web application that would revolutionize online energy management. This platform wasn't just about
                code; it was about enabling engineers to make informed decisions, enhancing user experiences, and
                promoting energy-efficient building practices.</p>

            <h3>Leading the Way</h3>
            <p>By 2018, my journey led me to a leadership role at Tahlilgaran. Entrusted with a team of 5 talented
                developers, we embarked on ambitious projects, building two comprehensive e-commerce web
                applications using Laravel 6 and Vue. Beyond development, I found joy in mentoring, providing
                technical support through a Support E-Ticketing Web Application developed with Laravel 5, and
                innovating in the e-learning space with platforms integrated with headless Moodle LMS.</p>

            <h3>Mastering Python</h3>
            <p>2019 was a year of specialization. Joining Tas'hil Gostar, I delved deep into Python. Leading the
                development of diverse Python-based applications, I explored realms from payroll to account
                management. My work here involved designing and implementing database models using Odoo ERP,
                ensuring data integrity, optimizing performance, and ensuring scalability. It solidified my belief
                in the power of Python and its vast applications.</p>

            <h3>The Current Chapter</h3>
            <p>Today, I find myself thriving at OWOW Agency in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Each day brings new challenges
                and opportunities as I develop and maintain cutting-edge full-stack applications. My toolkit has expanded
                to include React and Next.js, alongside my trusted companions Laravel and Vue. Projects like the 
                award-winning headless Shopify implementations showcase our team's innovation and my commitment to pushing
                boundaries. I've had the privilege of crafting custom Shopify applications, including an intricate 
                pool cover configurator that delighted our clients. As I continue to explore technologies like Docker, 
                AWS, and Vercel, I'm constantly amazed by the evolving landscape of web development. Looking back, 
                I'm filled with gratitude for the journey so far and brimming with excitement for the chapters yet to be
                written in this ever-changing digital saga.</p>

            <h3>Skills & Passion</h3>
            <p>Over the years, I've cultivated a diverse skill set, mastering languages from PHP and JavaScript to Python
                and Java. Frameworks and tools like Laravel, Vue, React, and Odoo have become extensions of my 
                problem-solving arsenal. But beyond the technical skills, it's the passion that truly defines my journey.
                The passion to tackle seemingly impossible challenges, to innovate in the face of complexity, to lead and
                mentor teams towards success. I thrive on optimizing performance, whether it's accelerating a Magento
                store by 70% or increasing software sales value by 400%. My commitment to continuous learning keeps me at
                the forefront of technology, always ready to embrace new tools and methodologies. It's this blend of
