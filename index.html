            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>My journey into the world of development began in 2010. As an independent freelancer, I was driven by
                the desire to create. Over seven transformative years, I crafted solutions for various clients,
                building projects like the Dena Porcelain Store and the Star VPN Store using cutting-edge
                technologies of the time. This period was instrumental in shaping my foundational skills and
                understanding of the industry.</p>

            <h3>Stepping into the Energy Sector</h3>
            <p>2017 marked a pivotal turn in my career. I joined Tabesh Rayan Energy in Tabriz, Iran. Here, I was
                introduced to the complexities of the energy sector. Using PHP, Laravel 4, and MySQL, I developed a
                web application that would revolutionize online energy management. This platform wasn't just about
                code; it was about enabling engineers to make informed decisions, enhancing user experiences, and
                promoting energy-efficient building practices.</p>

            <h3>Leading the Way</h3>
            <p>By 2018, my journey led me to a leadership role at Tahlilgaran. Entrusted with a team of 5 talented
                developers, we embarked on ambitious projects, building two comprehensive e-commerce web
                applications using Laravel 6 and Vue. Beyond development, I found joy in mentoring, providing
                technical support through a Support E-Ticketing Web Application developed with Laravel 5, and
                innovating in the e-learning space with platforms integrated with headless Moodle LMS.</p>

            <h3>Mastering Python</h3>
            <p>2019 was a year of specialization. Joining Tas'hil Gostar, I delved deep into Python. Leading the
                development of diverse Python-based applications, I explored realms from payroll to account
                management. My work here involved designing and implementing database models using Odoo ERP,
                ensuring data integrity, optimizing performance, and ensuring scalability. It solidified my belief
                in the power of Python and its vast applications.</p>

            <h3>The Current Chapter</h3>
            <p>Today, I find myself at OWOW Agency in Eindhoven, Netherlands. Every day is a new adventure,
                developing and maintaining full-stack applications. My work here has been deeply intertwined with
                Laravel and Vue, two tools that I've come to admire for their power and flexibility. Projects like
                the Steel-Solutions CMS and the E-Grounds gaming community stand testament to our team's dedication
                and my personal commitment to excellence. Venturing into e-commerce with Shopify, I've also had the
                opportunity to craft custom themes and plugins, tailoring solutions to meet unique client needs. As
                I look back, I'm filled with gratitude for the journey so far and excitement for the chapters yet to
                be written.</p>

            <h3>Skills & Passion</h3>
            <p>Over the years, I've honed a diverse skill set, mastering PHP, Python, TypeScript, and SQL.
                Frameworks like Laravel, Vue, and React have become second nature. But beyond the skills, it's the
                passion that drives me. The passion to solve, to innovate, to mentor, and to make a difference. It's
                this passion that fuels my journey, one line of code at a time.</p>
